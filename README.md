### Getting Started
1. I recommend you install python 3.6 and the virtual environment you prefer.
2. You need to download the Unity environment that matches your operating system:

    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
   You will need to use this file when you run the "Solution" notebook
 3. Run "jupyter notebook" and click in "Solution.ipynb" notebook.
 4. You need to run the first cell from "Solution.ipynb" notebook - with the command "!pip -q install ./python" - to install all python dependencies.
 5. In the "Solution.ipynb" notebook, in step 3, put the path of the Unity environment file downloaded.
